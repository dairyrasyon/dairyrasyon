Can be called without `new`.\n *\n * ##### presetName\n *\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\n *\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.mjs) -\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.mjs) -\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.mjs) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.mjs) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(str, { language: lang, ignoreIllegals: true }).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>` or `<code>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre><code class=\"hljs\">' +\n *                hljs.highlight(str, { language: lang, ignoreIllegals: true }).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre><code class=\"hljs\">' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt (presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options)\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {}\n      presetName = 'default'\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].

Backslashes are not replaced with slashes,\n//    so `http:\\\\example.org\\` is treated like a relative path\n//\n// 3. Trailing colon is treated like a part of the path,\n//    i.e. in `http://example.org:foo` pathname is `:foo`\n//\n// 4. Nothing is URL-encoded in the resulting object,\n//    (in joyent/node some chars in auth and paths are encoded)\n//\n// 5. `url.parse()` does not have `parseQueryString` argument\n//\n// 6. Removed extraneous result properties: `host`, `path`, `query`, etc.,\n//    which can be constructed using other parts of the url.\n//\n\nfunction Url () {\n  this.protocol = null;\n  this.slashes = null;\n  this.auth = null;\n  this.port = null;\n  this.hostname = null;\n  this.hash = null;\n  this.search = null;\n  this.pathname = null;\n}\n\n// Reference: RFC 3986, RFC 1808, RFC 2396\n\n// define these here so at least they only have to be\n// compiled once on the first module load.\nconst protocolPattern = /^([a-z0-9.+-]+:)/i;\nconst portPattern = /:[0-9]*$/;\n\n// Special case for a simple path URL\n/* eslint-disable-next-line no-useless-escape */\nconst simplePathPattern = /^(\\/\\/?(?!\\/)[^\\?\\s]*)(\\?[^\\s]*)?$/;\n\n// RFC 2396: characters reserved for delimiting URLs.\n// We actually just auto-escape these.\nconst delims = ['<', '>', '\"', '`', ' ', '\\r', '\\n', '\\t'];\n\n// RFC 2396: characters not allowed for various reasons.\nconst unwise = ['{', '}', '|', '\\\\', '^', '`'].concat(delims);\n\n// Allowed by RFCs, but cause of XSS attacks.
