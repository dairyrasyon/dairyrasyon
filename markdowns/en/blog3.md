# Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cows
The nutrient requirements of dairy cows vary depending on milk yield, age, live weight, lactation period and pregnancy status. These requirements mainly include essential nutrients such as energy, protein, vitamins, minerals and water. 
Here is a detailed explanation:
## 1. Energy Requirement
Energy is necessary for milk production, maintenance and reproduction. Energy deficiency reduces milk yield and negatively affects reproductive performance.
Sources: Corn, barley, wheat, silage, sugar beet pulp.
Energy measure: Total Digestible Nutrient (TSBM) or NEL (Net Energy Lactation).
## 2. Protein Requirement
Protein is important for milk protein synthesis and maintenance of muscle tissues.
Sources: Soybean meal, cottonseed meal, canola meal, alfalfa, legumes.
Crude protein requirement:
Dry period: 12-14%.
Lactation period: 16-18% (for high milk yield).
## 3. Vitamin Requirement
Vitamin A: Necessary for immune system and reproductive health.
Vitamin D: Regulates bone and mineral metabolism.
Vitamin E: Has antioxidant properties.
Vitamin K: Supports blood clotting.
## 4. Mineral Requirement
Macro minerals: Calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na).
Micro minerals: Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iodine (I), selenium (Se).
Especially calcium and phosphorus are critical for milk production and bone health.
## 5. Fiber (NDF and ADF)
Dairy cows should have sufficient levels of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in their rations.
Fiber supports rumination and digestive health.
## 6. Water
Water is the most important nutrient for dairy cows.
Daily water requirement: 40-120 liters (varies according to milk yield and environmental conditions).
The amount of water consumed by dairy cows directly affects milk yield.

## Sample Nutrient Requirements:
### 1. Low milk yield (10-20 kg/day):
Energy: 20-25 Mcal NEL/day.
Protein: 1.5-2.0 kg/day.
### 2. High milk yield (30 kg/day and above):
Energy: 30-40 Mcal NEL/day.
Protein: 2.5-3.0 kg/day.
### 3. Dry Period Requirement:
Energy: Lower (at a level that will maintain body condition).
Protein: 12-14%.
### 4. Lactation Periods and Requirements:
Early Lactation: Energy requirement is highest.
Middle Lactation: Milk yield decreases, needs decrease.
Late Lactation: The aim is to rebuild body reserves.

## Ration Planning:
When planning a ration, a balance of roughage (60-70%) and concentrated feed (30-40%) should be created to meet the needs of the animal. Silage, hay, grains and mineral supplements should be used in a balanced manner.
