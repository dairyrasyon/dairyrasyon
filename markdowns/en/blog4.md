# Dry Period Calcium Requirements and Milk Fever (Hypocalcemia) in Dairy Cows
Dry period calcium requirement and milk fever (hypocalcemia) in dairy cows are very important issues in terms of animal health and milk yield. Here is basic information about these topics:
## Dry Period Calcium Requirement
The dry period is a period when milk production is stopped in order for dairy cows to prepare for their next lactation, and calcium balance is of great importance during this period.
### Calcium Requirement:
A cow in the dry period needs approximately 25-30 grams of calcium per day. This amount may vary depending on the animal's body weight, pregnancy status and daily feed consumption.
### Purpose:
During the dry period, the calcium level of the diet is kept low (usually 0.4-0.6%). The purpose of this is to encourage the cow's body to regulate calcium metabolism. This process increases the cow's calcium absorption and mobilization to meet the high calcium needs after birth.
### Diet Strategies:
* Low Calcium Diet: The calcium level of the ration is limited during the dry period. However, to implement this strategy, the calcium level in the feeds must be calculated correctly.
* DCAD Diet: Dietary Cation Anion Balance (DCAD) is used to increase calcium absorption by adjusting the acid-base balance of feeds. This diet can be applied by supplementing with anionic salts.

## Milk Fever (Hypocalcemia)
Milk fever is a condition in which the blood calcium level drops excessively (hypocalcemia) and usually occurs immediately after birth.

### Causes:
* Sudden increase in calcium need with milk production after birth.
* Inadequate calcium mobilization.
* Inadequate vitamin D level or inappropriate dietary strategies.
### Symptoms:
1. Subclinical Hypocalcemia (Indeterminate form):
* Low feed consumption.
* Weakened immune system.
* Increased secondary problems such as metritis and ketosis.
2. Clinical Hypocalcemia (Milk Fever):
* Muscle tremors, difficulty walking.
* Animal lying on the ground and not being able to stand up.
* Decreased digestive activity (bloating and loss of appetite).
* Risk of death.
### Treatment:
1. Calcium Supplementation:
* Intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) calcium solutions are applied.
2. Vitamin D:
* Important for increasing calcium absorption.

### Preventive Measures:
1. Dry Period Diet:
* Application of DCAD diet.
* Feeding low calcium content feeds.
2. Mineral Supplements:
* Giving calcium supplements a few weeks before parturition.
3. Ration Support:
* Balanced magnesium and phosphorus levels support calcium metabolism.

## Summary
Correct calcium management during the dry period reduces the risk of milk fever and supports the health of the animal after parturition. Dietary adjustments, mineral supplements and monitoring of metabolic processes are essential for a successful lactation period.
