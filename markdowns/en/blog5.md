# Nutrition of Dairy Cows During Lactation Period

Proper nutrition of dairy cows during lactation period is of great importance for both milk yield and animal health. Energy, protein, mineral and vitamin needs of lactating cows increase. Here are the basic nutrition principles to be considered during this period:

## 1. Energy Requirement
- **High Energy Feeds:** Energy requirement is very high during the first period of lactation, therefore energy sources such as quality corn silage, grain and oil additives should be provided.  
- **Negative Energy Balance (NEB):** Cows generally do not receive enough energy in the first weeks of lactation and use their body reserves. This can lead to problems such as fat accumulation and ketosis. Energy-dense feeds should be given to prevent this.

## 2. Protein Requirement
- **Highly Digestible Protein:** Protein sources such as soybean meal, sunflower meal and canola meal can be used.  
- **Nitrogen Sources:** Nitrogen sources such as urea can support protein synthesis in ruminants, but should be given in a balanced way.

## 3. Mineral and Vitamin Support
- **Calcium and Phosphorus:** A large amount of calcium is consumed during milk production. Calcium and phosphorus balance should be provided to prevent hypocalcemia (milk fever).  
- **Magnesium:** Especially important during the grazing period, it prevents grass tetany.  
- **Vitamins A, D and E:** Necessary for the immune system and reproductive health.  
- **Salt and Trace Minerals:** Minerals such as sodium, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium are vital for dairy cows.

## 4. Fiber and Digestive System Health
- **NDF Levels:** It is important to provide adequate NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber) levels for ruminant digestion. This balances rumen pH and reduces the risk of acidosis.  
- **Quality Forage:** Quality forage such as alfalfa, hay and meadow grass should make up 50-60% of the ration.

## 5. Water Consumption
- **Water Requirement:** Dairy cows need a lot of water for milk production. They may need to consume between 40-100 liters of water per day.  
- **Water Accessibility:** Water should always be clean and easily accessible.

## 6. Ration Preparation
- **TMR System:** The total mixed feed (TMR) system can be preferred when preparing the ration. This ensures that the feeds are mixed homogeneously and that the cows receive sufficient amounts of each nutrient.  
- **Balanced Ratio:** The ratio of forage and concentrate in the ration should be balanced (e.g. 60% forage, 40% concentrate).

## 7. Nutrition According to Lactation Periods
- **Early Lactation (first 100 days):** There is a high energy and protein requirement. Milk yield is at its peak.  
- **Middle Lactation (100-200 days):** Milk yield begins to decrease, but energy needs continue.  
- **Late Lactation (after 200 days):** Milk yield decreases, dry matter consumption increases. Body condition is improved during this period.

> Preparing the right ration and regular veterinary control play an important role in maintaining the health and productivity of cows during lactation. It would be beneficial to conduct feed analysis according to needs and consult a nutritionist when necessary.
