# Cereals Such as Barley, Corn, Wheat and Triticale, Nutrition of Dairy Cows

Cereals such as barley, corn, wheat and triticale play an important role in the nutrition of dairy cows due to their high energy and protein content. These grains can meet the energy needs of cows and increase milk yield and quality. However, the digestive properties and nutrient contents of each grain are different, so care should be taken when preparing the ration.

## Digestion and Processing of Grains

- **Wheat, barley and triticale**: The starches of these grains ferment quickly in the rumen, which can cause rapid release of short-chain fatty acids and potentially cause rumen acidosis. Therefore, it is recommended that the grains be broken into 3-4 pieces when these grains are included in the ration. In addition, the amount in the ration should not exceed 4 kg per day, otherwise digestive problems and a decrease in milk fat content may be observed.

- **Corn**: Corn starch ferments more slowly in the rumen and a larger portion reaches the small intestine where it is absorbed as glucose. This reduces the risk of rumen acidosis and provides an advantage in terms of energy supply. It is recommended that corn grains be finely ground and added to the ration.

## Ration Preparation and Balancing

- Including grains in the ration is effective in meeting the energy needs of cows; however, excessive grain use can reduce rumen pH and increase the risk of acidosis. 
- Therefore, the balance of roughage and concentrated feed in the ration should be well adjusted. Generally, 45% of the ration should consist of roughage (e.g. corn silage, alfalfa, wheat straw, oats) and the rest should consist of grain feeds (e.g. barley, corn, soybean meal, factory feed).

## Recommendations

- Appropriate processing techniques should be used to increase the digestibility of cereal grains.  
- The amount of grain in the ration should be carefully adjusted and sudden increases should be avoided.  
- The health status and milk yield of the cows should be monitored regularly and ration adjustments should be made when necessary.

> **In conclusion**, grains such as barley, corn, wheat and triticale are valuable components in the diet of dairy cows. However, the ration should be carefully planned and balanced, taking into account the characteristics of each grain.
