# Feeding Dairy Cows With Clover, Sainfoin And Vetch

Legume forage plants such as clover, sainfoin and vetch have an important place in the nutrition of dairy cows. These forage plants support milk yield and the general health of cows thanks to their high protein, energy, vitamin and mineral content. Here is the role of these plants in the nutrition of dairy cows:

## 1. Clover (*Medicago sativa*)
- Rich in protein (Crude protein ratio is around 15-22%).  
- Supports rumen health as it is highly digestible and has a balanced fiber content.  
- Rich in calcium, which is effective in increasing milk yield.  
- Since it can cause bloating (tympani) when consumed in excessive amounts, a balanced ration should be prepared.

## 2. Sainfoin (*Onobrychis sativa*)
- It is a high-quality forage plant like alfalfa, but it does not cause bloating.  
- Since it contains tannin, protein digestion is more balanced and protects intestinal health.  
- It has high mineral content, especially phosphorus and calcium.  
- It can be used as dry grass or silage feed.

## 3. Vetch (*Vicia spp.*)
- Its crude protein ratio is around 18-22%, so it has an effect of increasing milk yield.  
- It has high digestibility and can be used by mixing with alfalfa.  
- Its energy content is slightly lower than alfalfa, so it is recommended to support it with grains.  
- It can be used for grazing, dry grass and silage.

## Use of These Feeds for Dairy Cows

- **It Should Be Added to the Ration in a Balanced Way**: Since alfalfa, vetch and sainfoin contain high protein, if given in excess, they can reduce rumen pH and cause acidosis. Therefore, they should be balanced with fibrous feeds (e.g. hay or corn silage).  

- **It Can Be Used as Silage or Dry Grass**: Alfalfa and vetch can also be used by making silage, but fermentation in the silage must be good, otherwise the quality will decrease.  

- **Should be Supported with Grains**: Since they are rich in protein, if they are supported with carbohydrate-containing grains such as corn and barley, the energy-protein balance is provided.  

- **Vitamin and Mineral Support**: Since alfalfa and vetch are rich in calcium, if given in excess, they can disrupt the phosphorus balance. Therefore, phosphorus supplementation should be made.

## Conclusion

Alfalfa, sainfoin and vetch are feeds with high nutritional value for dairy cows, increase milk yield and create a healthy feeding strategy. However, the ration should be planned carefully to avoid excessive protein load and provide energy balance. These legume forage plants provide high milk yield and healthy animal development, especially when used with grain and fiber feeds.
