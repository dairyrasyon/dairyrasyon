# Use Of Fats In Dairy Cow Nutrition

Using fat in dairy cow diets is an important strategy to support milk yield by increasing energy density and to maintain metabolic balance. However, if the right type and amount of fat is not added, digestive problems and changes in milk composition may occur.

## 1. Importance of Fats for Dairy Cows
- **High Energy Density:** 1 gram of fat contains â‰ˆ 9 kcal of energy, which is approximately 2.25 times more than carbohydrates.  
- **Increases Milk Yield:** Supports milk production by closing the energy gap in high-yielding cows.  
- **Prevents Weight Loss:** Helps to maintain body condition during lactation.  
- **Reduces Metabolic Diseases:** Reduces the risk of ketosis, especially beneficial for cows experiencing energy deficit after birth.  
- **May Increase Milk Fat:** Fat sources rich in unsaturated fatty acids in particular may affect milk fat ratio.

## 2. Fat Sources Added to Dairy Cows' Rations

### A. Natural Fat Sources

1. **Vegetable Oils** (Soybean oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil)  
   - Rich in Omega-6, but can disrupt rumen fermentation when consumed in excess.  
   - Can increase milk yield in controlled use, but can reduce milk fat in excessive amounts.

2. **Seeds and Kernels** (Cottonseed, soybean, flaxseed)  
   - Those in a protective coated (bypass) form are more beneficial for milk yield.  
   - Sources such as flaxseed are rich in Omega-3 and support immunity.

3. **Fatty Feeds** (Legumes such as alfalfa, vetch and corn by-products)  
   - They naturally contain a certain amount of fat.

### B. Animal Fat Sources

- **Butter and Animal Fats** (Tallow, Fish Oil)  
  - Can negatively affect rumen health, especially those in free fat form.  
  - Fish oil can contribute to reproductive health because it contains omega-3, but it should be given in limited amounts.

### C. Protected (Bypass) Fats

1. **Calcium Soaps** (Palm Oil Derivatives)  
   - It is digested in the intestine without being broken down by the rumen.  
   - It is safe to increase milk yield and energy intake.

2. **Hydrogenated Fats**  
   - It is in a more stable form and interacts less in the rumen.  
   - However, some varieties can reduce milk fat content.

## 3. Things to Consider When Using Fat
- The fat content in the total ration should not exceed 5-6%, otherwise it will disrupt rumen fermentation and prevent fiber digestion.  
- Unsaturated fatty acids (especially vegetable oils) can reduce milk fat content when excessive in the rumen.  
- If whole seeds are given without processing, digestive efficiency decreases. Therefore, it is recommended to give them in heated or crushed form.  
- A slow adaptation process is necessary; adding too much fat suddenly can lower rumen pH and cause digestive problems.

## 4. Conclusion
Fats are an effective source of nutrients to meet the energy needs of high-yielding dairy cows. However, it is important to choose the right type and amount of fat. Bypass fats are the safest source of fat for dairy cows because they provide energy without affecting rumen fermentation. When used in a controlled manner, they can increase milk yield, support reproductive health and prevent metabolic diseases.
